The North Carolina Medical Facilities (2020) map was created in order to assist in easily locating and differentiating medical facility types across North Carolina during the Covid-19 pandemic. This map allows the user to look at various facility types in different locations and observe patterns brought out by the location of various facilities. This map can be used to better determine the prime location for vaccine dispersal as well as viable facilities in which vaccines can be dispersed for various demographic types. The map can also be used to better determine the best location for new facilities across the state.
The medical facility locations were provided my NC One Map, and the base map by Open Street Map.
